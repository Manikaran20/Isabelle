text {* Even after proving a lot of certain things we were still unable to prove these main theorems
in Casati and Varzi @{cite "casati_parts_1999"}. It seems to be a serious error. *}

text {* I think the error occurs because the relation connectedness is not provided with any strong 
enough axiom to prove much about it. We also think the following may be a counterexample; Suppose there
are four simple individuals (a simple or an atom is an individual that has no parts other than itself):
a, b, c and d. Suppose a is connected to b, and c is connected to d, and there are no more connections
amongst the four simples. But suppose also that a + b is connected to c + d. (It follows that all the
other complex (non-simple) individuals are connected as well, but that is not important). It follows that
both a and b are interior parts of a + b, and both c and d are interior parts of c + d, so the interior of
a + b is a + b itself, and the interior of c + d is c + d itself. The exterior of a + b is the interior of its complement, which is c + d. The closure 
of a + b is the complement of its exterior, so that's just a + b. Likewise, the closure of c + d is 
also c + d.*}

text {* It seems to us (but we have not yet verified formally) that this counterexample satisfies all the
axioms of GEMTC, without satisfying the theorems that we could not prove above. *}
